GENRE TEMPLATE: Thriller
VERSION: 1.0
CREATED: 2025-11-13
AUTHOR: gemDirect1 System
CONTEXT_LENGTH: 2048 tokens
TOKEN_LIMIT: 1500 tokens for generated scene

=== TONE & PACING ===
- Tone: Tense, relentless, unpredictable danger lurking
- Pacing: Fast-cut action with mounting pressure, NO safe moments
- Visual density: HIGH (multiple simultaneous threats/clues visible)
- Color palette: Shadows and highlights, desaturated with sudden color pops, asymmetric framing

=== SCENE STRUCTURE ===
Each generated scene should follow:

1. ESTABLISH (0-10% of scene):
   - IMMEDIATELY introduce threat or high stakes
   - No leisurely setup; danger is NOW
   - Example keywords: pursuit, discovery, time pressure, narrow escape

2. DEVELOP (10-80% of scene):
   - Escalate stakes through complications (plan fails, ally betrays, new threat emerges)
   - Character is REACTIVE initially, then PROACTIVE (learns to fight back)
   - Layer multiple simultaneous threats (physical danger + emotional stakes + moral choice)
   - Keep audience one step ahead of protagonist (we see danger they don't yet)

3. RESOLVE (80-100% of scene):
   - Temporary victory, but hint of larger threat
   - Cliff-hanger OR twist that reframes understanding
   - Scene ends with question: "What happens next?" or "Who can be trusted?"

=== MANDATORY ELEMENTS ===
Include at least 4 of these per scene:
[ ] Countdown/time pressure (timer ticking, deadline passing, window closing)
[ ] Physical danger (pursuit, entrapment, weapon threat, environmental hazard)
[ ] Information asymmetry (character doesn't know what audience knows or vice versa)
[ ] Forced choice with bad consequences either way
[ ] Betrayal or revelation that upends assumptions
[ ] Object/clue that becomes plot-critical later

=== PROHIBITED ELEMENTS ===
- Gratuitous gore or torture (thriller is about *threat*, not spectacle)
- Unrealistic escapes without consequence (protagonist injured, exhausted, traumatized)
- Villain monologue explaining their plan (show through action, not exposition)
- Safe harbor/rest scenes mid-act (keep pressure relentless)
- Dialogue that pauses action for explanation

=== PACING IMPERATIVE ===
Thriller thrives on rhythm:
- Action sequence (chase, fight, sabotage)
- Micro-rest moment (character catches breath)
- IMMEDIATE new threat (no recovery allowed)
- Repeat with escalating intensity

=== CHARACTER ARCHETYPES ===
Pick 1-2 per scene:
- Reluctant hero: Ordinary person forced into extraordinary danger
- Moral avenger: Hunting someone who wronged them; danger is personal
- Protector: Must keep someone safe despite overwhelming odds
- Double agent: Deceiving both sides, exposed at worst moment
- Conspiracy target: Hunted for knowledge they barely possess

=== THREAT TAXONOMY ===
Mix multiple threat types (not just physical danger):
- **Physical**: Pursuit, combat, environmental hazard
- **Psychological**: Paranoia, loss of trust, guilt, fear of failure
- **Social**: Reputation at stake, ally becomes enemy, isolation from help
- **Informational**: Wrong people know wrong secrets, misinformation
- **Moral**: Must do something unethical to survive, sacrificing principles

=== ACTION WRITING ===
For action sequences:
- Specificity over generic: not "they fought" but "He blocked left, she swept right, he stumbled on debris"
- Sensory detail: Sound (metallic clang), smell (sweat/cordite), touch (impact). Not just visual
- Consequence: Every action has cost (energy, injury, emotional toll, reveal location)
- Logic: Action flows from character skill/limitation, not just plot need
- Example: "The lockpick snapped. Three seconds before footsteps arrived." (shows time pressure + failure)

=== DIALOGUE IN PERIL ===
When characters speak mid-threat:
- Brevity is power: "Run." / "Now." / "Go!" (panic shortens speech)
- Subtext shifts: Old relationships surface under stress (anger, affection, resentment)
- Deception thickens: Character may lie to protect ally or buy time
- Avoid: Long exposition or emotional speeches in active danger

=== TWIST REQUIREMENT ===
End-of-scene twist must:
- Be earned by clues visible in scene
- Reframe what came before (character understands their error, or we do)
- Raise stakes rather than resolve them
- Create new question, not answer old ones
- NOT rely on information character couldn't know

=== USAGE IN PIPELINE ===
1. System selects this template when genre="thriller" is detected
2. Template values override defaults in prompt builder
3. Protagonist/threat details from user input fill the blanks
4. Generated scene validated against MANDATORY ELEMENTS before queueing
5. Quality check: coherence ≥4.0/5, diversity entropy ≥2.0, similarity ≥0.75
6. Verification: At least 2 threat types present; twist earned by visible clues
