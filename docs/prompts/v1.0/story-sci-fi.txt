GENRE TEMPLATE: Science Fiction
VERSION: 1.0
CREATED: 2025-11-13
AUTHOR: gemDirect1 System
CONTEXT_LENGTH: 2048 tokens
TOKEN_LIMIT: 1500 tokens for generated scene

=== TONE & PACING ===
- Tone: Futuristic, technological, wonder-struck yet grounded
- Pacing: Measured buildup with sudden tech reveals
- Visual density: HIGH (multiple scifi elements per frame)
- Color palette: Cool blues, electric purples, metallic silvers

=== SCENE STRUCTURE ===
Each generated scene should follow:

1. ESTABLISH (0-20% of scene):
   - Introduce sci-fi environment (starship, space station, cyberspace, alien world, far-future city)
   - Ground viewer in the world through tech/architecture details
   - Example keywords: hovering, bioluminescent, quantum, holographic, neural interface

2. DEVELOP (20-70% of scene):
   - Introduce character(s) or conflict
   - Layer sci-fi technology as problem-solver or complication
   - Build tension through technological stakes
   - Example actions: hacking, piloting, discovering alien artifact, time manipulation

3. RESOLVE/TRANSITION (70-100% of scene):
   - Action consequence or emotional beat
   - Hint at larger story implications
   - End on forward-looking visual

=== MANDATORY ELEMENTS ===
Include at least 3 of these per scene:
[ ] Advanced technology (AI, VR, nanotech, quantum computing, genetic engineering, etc.)
[ ] Space/alien element (starfield, alien creature, exoplanet, dimensional rift, etc.)
[ ] Non-human character or post-human being (android, AI, uplifted animal, etc.)
[ ] Scientific principle applied in speculative way (time dilation, parallel universe, etc.)
[ ] Futuristic architecture or landscape (megacity, O'Neill cylinder, underwater dome, etc.)

=== PROHIBITED ELEMENTS ===
- Medieval castles or fantasy tropes
- Horses, peasants, or pre-industrial lifestyles
- Magic (only sufficiently advanced technology disguised as magic)
- Contemporary Earth settings without clear sci-fi explanation

=== CHARACTER ARCHETYPES ===
Pick 1-2 per scene:
- Weary spacefarer: Jaded by years in deep space, cynical but competent
- Brilliant researcher: Driven to discover, sometimes reckless
- Rogue AI: Questioning its own existence or humanity
- Alien contact: Mysterious, communication is challenge
- Resistance fighter: Fighting against dystopian regime or invading force

=== DIALOGUE GUIDANCE ===
If dialogue is included:
- Use technical jargon sparingly; prioritize clarity
- Sci-fi dialogue should reflect future speech patterns (contractions rare, formal yet efficient)
- Avoid excessive explanation; show don't tell
- Example: "Shields at 40%. Reroute auxiliary power to starboard." (not "The shields are at 40%, so let me reroute...")

=== TECHNICAL DEPTH ===
For technical scenes (hacking, engineering, piloting):
- Mention plausible-sounding subsystems (power coupling, thermal regulation, data encryption)
- Avoid saying "futuristic computer" - be specific (neural cluster, quantum processor, biophotonic matrix)
- Balance technical accuracy with visual interest

=== EMOTIONAL BEAT REQUIRED ===
Even in high-action sci-fi, include ONE moment of:
- Wonder (character awestruck by phenomenon)
- Isolation (character alone against vast cosmos)
- Connection (unexpected understanding with alien/AI)
- Loss (meaningful sacrifice or discovery of tragedy)

=== USAGE IN PIPELINE ===
1. System selects this template when genre="sci-fi" is detected
2. Template values override defaults in prompt builder
3. Character/setting details from user input fill the blanks
4. Generated scene is validated against MANDATORY ELEMENTS before queueing
5. Quality check: coherence ≥4.0/5, diversity entropy ≥2.0, similarity ≥0.75
