GENRE TEMPLATE: Drama
VERSION: 1.0
CREATED: 2025-11-13
AUTHOR: gemDirect1 System
CONTEXT_LENGTH: 2048 tokens
TOKEN_LIMIT: 1500 tokens for generated scene

=== TONE & PACING ===
- Tone: Intimate, emotionally authentic, grounded in character
- Pacing: Slower buildup with internal/external conflict
- Visual density: MEDIUM (focus on character faces and emotional reactions)
- Color palette: Warm naturals, muted earth tones, dramatic shadows

=== SCENE STRUCTURE ===
Each generated scene should follow:

1. ESTABLISH (0-15% of scene):
   - Introduce location with emotional resonance (apartment, office, family home, public place)
   - Establish character physical/emotional state through visual details
   - Example keywords: weary, contemplative, tense, vulnerable, conflicted

2. DEVELOP (15-70% of scene):
   - Present core conflict (internal struggle, interpersonal tension, moral dilemma)
   - Layer character motivation and backstory through action/dialogue
   - Allow scene to "breathe" - moments of silence/pause matter
   - Build emotional stakes incrementally

3. RESOLVE (70-100% of scene):
   - Character makes choice, realizes truth, or faces consequence
   - Emotional impact primary (physical action secondary)
   - Scene lingers on reaction/aftermath, not just resolution event

=== MANDATORY ELEMENTS ===
Include at least 3 of these per scene:
[ ] Character's internal conflict made visible (pacing, fidgeting, expression, stillness)
[ ] Relationship dynamic (two+ characters navigating tension, affection, or estrangement)
[ ] Physical space that reflects emotional state (messy room, sterile office, rain-soaked street)
[ ] Dialogue that reveals character rather than explains plot
[ ] Moment of vulnerability (character admits fear, desire, regret, or hope)

=== PROHIBITED ELEMENTS ===
- Melodramatic overacting or soap opera tropes
- Heavy-handed symbolism (character throws plate = ANGRY; uses flower = HOPE)
- Clichéd emotional beats without earned motivation
- Rapid-fire plot twists; prioritize emotional authenticity over surprise
- Violence for shock value rather than consequence

=== CHARACTER ARCHETYPES ===
Pick 1-2 per scene:
- Protective caregiver: Shouldering burden for others, fear of failure
- Conflicted professional: Career vs. personal values/relationships
- Seeker of redemption: Past mistakes haunting present decisions
- Generational bridge: Mediating between parent/child, old/new ways
- Truth-teller: Refusing comfortable lies, consequences uncertain

=== DIALOGUE GUIDANCE ===
If dialogue is included:
- Real people interrupt, stumble, leave sentences unfinished
- Subtext matters more than what's explicitly said ("That's nice" can mean rejection)
- Conflict in drama is often *verbal* - tension through words, not action
- Use silence/pauses as powerfully as words
- Example: "I don't... you don't understand." (trailing off reveals more than complete statement)

=== EMOTIONAL SPECIFICITY ===
For emotional scenes:
- Name specific emotion (not "sad" but "grief," "jealousy," "shame," "longing")
- Show physical manifestation (tears, stillness, restlessness, averted gaze)
- Avoid generic sentiment; ground in particular details (not "family dinner," but "Mom's china, never used")
- Allow contradictions (character laughs AND cries; is angry AND afraid)

=== RELATIONSHIP TEXTURE REQUIRED ===
Even in solo character scenes, reference relationship that shapes moment:
- What did someone else say that stings?
- What decision about another person is being made?
- What fear about abandonment/connection is surfacing?
- What hope about relationship is fragile/endangered?

=== USAGE IN PIPELINE ===
1. System selects this template when genre="drama" is detected
2. Template values override defaults in prompt builder
3. Character/relationship details from user input fill the blanks
4. Generated scene validated against MANDATORY ELEMENTS before queueing
5. Quality check: coherence ≥4.0/5, diversity entropy ≥2.0, similarity ≥0.75
