# Archived Root Directory Files (November 2025)

This directory contains documentation and artifacts moved from the project root during Phase 3 Documentation Consolidation (2025-11-20).

## Purpose
These files were moved to improve project organization and reduce root directory clutter. They remain available for historical reference but are superseded by current documentation.
