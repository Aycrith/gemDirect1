# Archived Root Directory Files (November 2025)

This directory contains documentation and artifacts moved from the project root during documentation consolidation efforts (2025-11-20 through 2025-11-22).

## Purpose
These files were moved to improve project organization and reduce root directory clutter. They remain available for historical reference but are superseded by current documentation.

## Latest Addition (2025-11-22)
**44 additional files** moved during Test Infrastructure Documentation phase:
- Agent handoff documents (Nov 19-21)
- Phase 2 & 3 validation/completion reports
- Session summaries (Mistral Nemo, test fixes, LM integration)
- Validation system documents (commands, checklists, reports)

All superseded by current status in `Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS_CONSOLIDATED.md` and latest handoff `AGENT_HANDOFF_TEST_IMPROVEMENTS_20251122.md`.

**Current equivalent**: See \Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS_CONSOLIDATED.md\

### Guides (Superseded)
- MANUAL_WALKTHROUGH_GUIDE.md
- WALKTHROUGH_SETUP_COMPLETE.md

**Current equivalent**: See \README.md\ Quick Start section

### Planning Docs (Completed)
- NEXT_AGENT_COMPREHENSIVE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- NEXT_STEPS_COMPLETE_20251120.md

**Current status**: Phase 2 complete, see \AGENT_HANDOFF_PHASE2_COMPLETE_20251120.md\

### Test Artifacts
- *.log files (test runs, build logs, debug logs)
- *.png files (screenshots, test evidence)
- test-results-*.json (historical test data)

**Current data**: See \logs/\ directory for recent runs

## Migration Dates
- **November 20, 2025**: Initial archive (Phase 3 performance optimization session)
- **November 22, 2025**: Additional 44 files (Test infrastructure documentation phase)

## Rationale
Root directory cleanup as part of ongoing documentation consolidation efforts. All information has been:
1. Incorporated into current documentation (`Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS_CONSOLIDATED.md`)
2. Superseded by newer status reports (latest: `AGENT_HANDOFF_TEST_IMPROVEMENTS_20251122.md`)
3. Or archived for historical reference only

## Why These Were Archived
Many documents referenced outdated information:
- **"WAN2 blocker"** - Resolved as of 2025-11-19 (pipeline working, evidence in logs)
- **Test failures** - Fixed (97 passing, 0 failing as of 2025-11-22)
- **Performance concerns** - Addressed (20.9% improvement achieved)
- **Incomplete validation** - Completed with comprehensive test coverage

## Finding Current Information
- **Project Status**: \Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS_CONSOLIDATED.md\
- **Quick Start**: \README.md\
- **Recent Work**: \Development_History/Sessions/\
- **Test Results**: \logs/\ and \	est-results/\
- **Architecture**: \Documentation/Architecture/\
