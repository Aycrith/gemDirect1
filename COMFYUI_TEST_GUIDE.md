# ComfyUI Integration Test Guide

## ✅ Current Status

**ComfyUI Server Detected:**
- ✅ Running on **http://127.0.0.1:8000** (ComfyUI Desktop)
- ✅ CORS enabled for all origins (*** = wildcard)
- ✅ System stats accessible
- ✅ GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (CUDA)

**gemDirect1 App:**
- ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Updated to auto-discover port 8000

> **Docs-first reminder:** Before editing workflows or touching code, re-read README.md, every docs/STORY_TO_VIDEO_PIPELINE_PHASE_*.md, WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md, the QA/testing guides, and scripts/comfyui-status.ts so helper runtime expectations remain aligned.
>
> Story bibles now include a structured `heroArcs` array plus `heroArcId` per scene; all prompts and validations expect those arcs to surface in the generated JSON. The canonical WAN video workflow is `video_wan2_2_5B_ti2v.json`, so keep your local settings and helper metadata pointing at that 5B bundle and target 3–8 minute runs on RTX 3090. SVD runs remain optional regression checks triggered via `RUN_SVD_E2E=1`.

## 🔧 Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Open Settings Modal
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings icon** (top-right corner)
3. The "Local Generation Settings" modal will open

### Step 2: Discover/Configure ComfyUI
**Option A: Auto-Discovery (Recommended)**
1. Click the **"Auto-Discover"** button
2. The app will try:
   - http://127.0.0.1:8000 ✅ (should work!)
   - http://localhost:8000
   - http://127.0.0.1:8188
   - http://localhost:8188
3. When found, the URL field will auto-populate
4. Status should show: "✓ Server found at http://127.0.0.1:8000"

**Option B: Manual Entry**
1. In the "Server URL" field, enter: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Click **"Test Connection"**
3. Should show: "✓ Connected to ComfyUI"

### Step 3: View System Info
After connection, the pre-flight check should display:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
- **VRAM Total**: ~24 GB
- **VRAM Free**: ~[current free amount]
- **Queue Status**: 0 running, 0 pending

### Step 4: Sync Workflow
1. **Load a workflow in ComfyUI first!**
   - Open ComfyUI at http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - Load or create a workflow (e.g., default SD workflow)
   - Make sure it has at least:
     - CLIPTextEncode (for positive prompt)
     - LoadImage (for keyframe)
     - Optional: CLIPTextEncode (for negative prompt)

2. **In gemDirect1 Settings Modal:**
   - Click **"Sync Workflow from Server"**
   - The app will fetch the currently loaded workflow
   - Workflow JSON will appear (collapsed in UI)

### Step 5: Configure Mappings

**Automatic Mapping (AI-powered):**
1. After syncing, click **"Auto-Map Inputs"**
2. AI will analyze the workflow and suggest mappings
3. Review the suggested mappings:
   - `Human-Readable Prompt` → should map to positive CLIPTextEncode
   - `Keyframe Image` → should map to LoadImage
   - `Negative Prompt` → should map to negative CLIPTextEncode (if present)

**Manual Mapping:**
1. For each row in the mapping table:
   - **Left column**: Shows ComfyUI node info (e.g., "Node 6: CLIPTextEncode - text")
   - **Right column**: Dropdown to select app data type
2. Match them appropriately:
   - Positive text input → "Human-Readable Prompt"
   - Image input → "Keyframe Image"
   - Negative text input → "Negative Prompt"
   - Leave others as "none" if not needed

### Step 6: Run Pre-flight Checks
1. Click **"Run Pre-flight Checks"** button
2. All checks should pass:
   - ✅ Server Connection
   - ✅ System Resources (VRAM check)
   - ✅ Queue Status
   - ✅ Workflow Validity
   - ✅ Mapping Consistency

### Step 7: Save Settings
1. Click **"Save"** button
2. Settings are persisted to localStorage
3. Modal closes

## 🎬 Testing Generation

### Test 1: Simple Story Creation
1. Close the settings modal
2. Enter a story idea: "A detective in a cyberpunk city investigates a mysterious case"
3. Click "Generate Story Bible"
4. Wait for AI to generate logline, characters, setting, plot
5. Review and proceed to "Director's Vision"

### Test 2: Director's Vision
1. Click "Suggest Visions" for AI ideas, or enter your own:
   - Example: "Neo-noir aesthetic with neon lights, rain-soaked streets, high contrast shadows, cinematic wide shots"
2. Click "Generate Scenes"
3. AI will create 4-6 scenes with keyframe images

### Test 3: Timeline Editing
1. Click on a scene in the left sidebar
2. Review the shot list (3-4 initial shots)
3. Make a small edit to a shot description or add an enhancer
4. Verify changes save

### Test 4: Local Generation (The Main Test!)
1. In a scene with shots defined
2. Look for a button like:
   - "Generate Local Preview"
   - "Generate with ComfyUI"
   - Or a dropdown with "Local Generation" option
3. Click it
4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Pre-flight checks run automatically
   - Keyframe image uploads to ComfyUI
   - Workflow gets data injected
   - Prompt queued to ComfyUI
   - WebSocket connection established
   - Progress updates appear:
     - "Queued... Position: X"
     - "Executing: [Node Name]"
     - Progress bar: 0% → 100%
   - Final output displayed (image or video)

### Test 5: Verify in ComfyUI
While generation is running:
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in another tab
2. You should see:
   - The workflow with injected data
   - Green progress bars on executing nodes
   - Queue panel showing the job

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Auto-Discovery failed"
**Cause**: Port 8000 not in discovery list (should be fixed now)
**Solution**: Manually enter `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Issue: "Failed to sync workflow"
**Cause**: No workflow loaded in ComfyUI
**Solution**: 
1. Open ComfyUI (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
2. Load a workflow (Load Default, or drag & drop a workflow JSON)
3. Return to gemDirect1 and click "Sync Workflow" again

### Issue: "Mapping validation failed"
**Cause**: Workflow changed or mappings incorrect
**Solution**:
1. Re-sync workflow
2. Clear existing mappings
3. Re-configure mappings (auto or manual)

### Issue: "Failed to upload image"
**Cause**: ComfyUI input directory not writable
**Solution**: Check ComfyUI logs, verify permissions on `C:\COMFYUI\input`

### Issue: "Generation stuck at 0%"
**Cause**: WebSocket not connected
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console (F12) for WebSocket errors
2. Verify ComfyUI allows WebSocket connections
3. Try refreshing the page

### Issue: "Out of memory" during generation
**Cause**: Not enough VRAM
**Solution**:
1. In ComfyUI, reduce image resolution
2. Disable VAE or upscaling nodes
3. Check VRAM usage in settings pre-flight check

## 🎯 Expected Workflow Example

### ComfyUI Workflow Requirements
A minimal workflow that works with gemDirect1:

```
CheckpointLoaderSimple → CLIP → CLIPTextEncode (positive) ──┐
                                                              ├─→ KSampler → VAEDecode → SaveImage
EmptyLatentImage ───────────────────────────────────────────┤
                          CLIPTextEncode (negative) ─────────┘
```

### Mapping Configuration
```
Node 6: CLIPTextEncode (Positive) - text    → Human-Readable Prompt
Node 7: CLIPTextEncode (Negative) - text    → Negative Prompt
```

Note: For Image-to-Image or Image-to-Video workflows, also map:
```
Node 10: LoadImage - image                   → Keyframe Image
```

## ?? Helper & QA Telemetry

- Always run `npx ts-node scripts/comfyui-status.ts --project ./path/to/exported-project.json --summary-dir test-results/comfyui-status --log-path test-results/comfyui-status/comfyui-status.log` before queuing scenes so the helper validates both `wan-t2i` and `wan-i2v` workflows, confirms the CLIPTextEncode and LoadImage mappings, and captures queue/system telemetry for QA cards and Playwright traces.
- Archive each helper summary/log under `test-results/comfyui-status/` so downstream checks (Playwright specs, Visual Bible prompts, plan expansion logs) can point to the same VRAM snapshots, queue warnings, and mapping highlights the helper reported.
- Mirror the helper's `LOCAL_*` env vars via `VITE_LOCAL_*` so the React UI, Playwright suites, and LM Studio integration all observe the same endpoint, seed, and timeout settings; any drift will show up as mismatched helper metadata in the archived summaries.

**Note**: The app has been updated to prioritize port 8000 in auto-discovery, so it should find your ComfyUI Desktop instance immediately!
