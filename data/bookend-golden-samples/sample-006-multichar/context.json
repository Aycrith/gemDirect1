    "summary": "A single cream-colored ceramic coffee mug with latte art sits in sharp focus on a warm wooden counter. The primary focus is this one mug - it never moves, never multiplies, never changes. In the blurred background, a single barista in a black apron pours from one consistent stainless steel pitcher (not a flask, not a coffee pot - always the same single pitcher).",

    "prompt": "A single cream-colored ceramic coffee mug with latte art in sharp focus, centered on a warm wooden counter, gentle steam rising, warm ambient lighting, shallow depth of field, blurred background shows one barista in black apron holding one stainless steel pitcher at espresso machine, coffee shop interior, cozy atmosphere, professional photography, 4K resolution, static camera, clean composition, only one mug visible, only one pitcher visible",

    "motionDescription": "The foreground mug remains absolutely still in place - it never moves, never multiplies. Steam rises naturally from the same mug.
